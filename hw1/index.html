		<h2><em>Hi there!</em></h2>
		<p>My name is <strong>Christa J. Baca</strong>. I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at UTSA. I'm more of an artist at heart, so while I do enjoy some of the lower-level interactions with computers, honestly I just way prefer the UI side of things. I hope to use a lot of what I learn in this class to make websites on my own, ones that are hopefully more mobile friendly (which I struggle with at the moment).</p>

		<h3>Projects</h3>
		<p><strong>Virus Video Game</strong>, Spring 2022 <em>(Created with Unity, Blender, and C#)</em></p>
		<p>I was the project leader for my Game Development class group project. Our idea was to create a low-poly 3D game in which the playable character has the ability to spread a deadly virus to enemy NPCs. I helped with narrowing down group ideas, coordinating meetings, writing documentation, and encouraging communication with all members. Along with developing scripts for core UI components such as the main menu, I also created original 3D models, generated their rigs, and made their own idle/walking animations. </p>
		<p><strong>Username Generator Website</strong>, Spring 2022 <em>(Created with JavaScript, HTML/CSS with Bootstrap)</em></p>
		<p>As part of a Hackathon project in a team of two people, I helped developed the core interface and functionality of a username generator website, hosted using GitHub Pages. Names are generated using a hash key for the inputted string, with an adjective followed by a noun for the random name output. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Base Conversion Calculator and Quiz Application</strong>, Fall 2020 <em>(Created with Java and JavaFX)</em></p>
		<p>Developed with a team using Agile methodologies to create a Base Conversion application for CS students to study for common problems encountered in math-related courses for the degree.</p>
		<p><strong>Card Video Game</strong>, Summer 2022 <em>(Created with Unity, Krita, C#)</em></p>
		<p>This is a personal project that I am working on with my best friend, based off a comic series that we're working on together. It's still a work in progress, but as of now, I've created all of the assets, including the textures, 3D card models, and unique card artwork.</p>
