          <strong>Virus Video Game</strong>, Spring 2022
          <em>(Created with Unity, Blender, and C#)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          I was the project leader for my Game Development class group project.
          Our idea was to create a low-poly 3D game in which the playable
          character has the ability to spread a deadly virus to enemy NPCs. I
          helped with narrowing down group ideas, coordinating meetings, writing
          documentation, and encouraging communication with all members. Along
          with developing scripts for core UI components such as the main menu,
          I also created original 3D models, generated their rigs, and made
          their own idle/walking animations.

        <p>
          As part of a Hackathon project in a team of two people, I helped
          developed the core interface and functionality of a username generator
          website, hosted using GitHub Pages. Names are generated using a hash
          key for the inputted string, with an adjective followed by a noun for
          the random name output.

          This is a personal project that I am working on with my best friend,
          based off a comic series that we're working on together. It's still a
          work in progress, but as of now, I've created all of the assets,
          including the textures, 3D card models, and unique card artwork.
